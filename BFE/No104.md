No.104 question of BFE.dev.

This question is asking us to traverse dom level by level, so it’s a BFS obviously, to achieve a BFS, we need to use queue this data structure.

Before we start, it’s necessary to take a check of edge case, so if root is ull return an empty array.

Then, we initialize a queue which equals to [root], so at this time, there is the root node of DOM in this queue, and we also need a result to load each element of DOM, then we can use a while loop to iterate through the queue and shift an element of it then push the shifted element into the result. After this, our queue is empty, so we need to push left DOM into our queue, and DOM nodes have their children nodes, so we can simply push their children and use a spread operator.

After that, our work is done, and we can return our result.
```javascript
function flatten(root) {
  if (!root) return []

  const queue = [root]
  const result = []

  while(queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift()
    result.push(node)
    queue.push(...node.children)
  }

  return result
}
```
